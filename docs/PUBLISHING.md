# GreenPaste Publishing Checklist

## Overview
Distribution channels:
1. **Android** → Google Play Store
2. **macOS** → Direct download with Apple notarization (website)

Mac App Store is deferred to a later phase. Pricing is free for now; Android may add paid Pro features later (rich content transfer).

## Phase 1: Android — Google Play Store

### 1.1 Developer Account Setup
- [ ] Create a Google Play Developer account ($25 one-time fee) at https://play.google.com/console
- [ ] Complete identity verification (personal or organization)
- [ ] Set up a developer profile (name, email, website, privacy policy URL)

### 1.2 Release Signing
- [ ] Generate a production keystore (`greenpaste-release.keystore`) — **back up securely, losing this = can never update the app**
- [ ] Add `signingConfigs` block to `android/app/build.gradle.kts` for the `release` build type
- [ ] Configure ProGuard/R8 minification for release builds
- [ ] Update `build-all.sh` to support `--release` flag producing a signed AAB (Android App Bundle, required by Play Store)
- [ ] Verify the release build installs and runs correctly on a real device

### 1.3 Store Listing Assets
- [ ] App icon: 512x512 PNG (high-res, no transparency)
- [ ] Feature graphic: 1024x500 PNG
- [ ] Screenshots: minimum 2, recommended 4-8 (phone + tablet if applicable)
  - Show pairing flow (QR scan)
  - Show clipboard sync in action
  - Show share sheet integration
- [ ] Short description (80 chars max)
- [ ] Full description (4000 chars max)
- [ ] App category: Tools / Productivity

### 1.4 Policy & Legal
- [ ] Write a privacy policy (required — explain BLE-only, no cloud, no data collection)
- [ ] Host privacy policy at a public URL (can be a GitHub Pages site or the future website)
- [ ] Complete the Data Safety questionnaire in Play Console
  - Data collected: None (clipboard data is transient, never persisted or transmitted to servers)
  - Encryption: Yes (AES-256-GCM end-to-end)
- [ ] Complete the App Content declarations (target audience, ads, etc.)

### 1.5 App Review Prep
- [ ] Ensure `targetSdk` is current (currently 35 — check latest requirement)
- [ ] Add BLE permission rationale strings in `strings.xml` for runtime permission dialogs
- [ ] Test all permission flows on a fresh install (BLE, notifications, nearby devices)
- [ ] Verify app works correctly after being killed/restarted by system

### 1.6 First Release
- [ ] Create an internal testing track first (invite a few testers)
- [ ] Graduate to closed/open testing if desired
- [ ] Submit for production release
- [ ] Monitor the review process (typically 1-3 days for first submission)

---

## Phase 2: macOS — Direct Download + Notarization

### 2.1 Apple Developer Account
- [ ] Enroll in Apple Developer Program ($99/year) at https://developer.apple.com
- [ ] Set up Developer ID Application certificate (for distribution outside the App Store)
- [ ] Set up a Developer ID Installer certificate (for .pkg if needed)

### 2.2 Code Signing & Notarization
- [ ] Add code signing to the build process using `codesign` with the Developer ID certificate
- [ ] Sign all embedded frameworks/binaries (if any)
- [ ] Set up `notarytool` for submitting to Apple's notarization service
- [ ] Add hardened runtime entitlements file:
  - `com.apple.security.device.bluetooth` (CoreBluetooth)
  - Any other required entitlements
- [ ] Update `build-all.sh` to support `--release` flag that signs, notarizes, and staples
- [ ] Verify the notarized app launches without Gatekeeper warnings on a clean Mac

### 2.3 Distribution Packaging
- [ ] Create a `.dmg` installer (drag GreenPaste.app to Applications)
- [ ] Sign and notarize the `.dmg` itself
- [ ] Consider adding a "Login Items" helper or prompt for launch-at-login setup
- [ ] Set up Sparkle (or similar) for auto-updates — include an `appcast.xml` feed URL
- [ ] Determine version numbering scheme (semver, build numbers for each release)

### 2.4 Website
- [ ] Register a domain (e.g., `greenpaste.app` or similar)
- [ ] Create a simple landing page with:
  - App description and key features
  - Download button for macOS `.dmg`
  - Link to Google Play Store for Android
  - Privacy policy page
  - Minimum system requirements (macOS 13+, Android 10+)
- [ ] Set up HTTPS (e.g., Cloudflare, Netlify, GitHub Pages with custom domain)
- [ ] Host the Sparkle appcast.xml for macOS auto-updates

---

## Phase 3: Shared / Cross-Cutting

### 3.1 Branding & Assets
- [ ] Finalize app icon for both platforms (consistent design)
- [ ] Create status bar icon variants if needed (light/dark mode)
- [ ] Write marketing copy (tagline, description)

### 3.2 Privacy Policy & Legal
- [ ] Write a single privacy policy covering both platforms
- [ ] Host at a stable URL (e.g., `greenpaste.app/privacy`)
- [ ] Consider adding a simple Terms of Service

### 3.3 Version & Release Management
- [ ] Align version numbers across platforms (both currently 0.1.0)
- [ ] Decide on a 1.0.0 release version or keep as 0.x for early access
- [ ] Set up a CHANGELOG or release notes workflow
- [ ] Consider GitHub Releases for tracking versions and attaching macOS binaries

---

## Future / Deferred

- [ ] Mac App Store submission (requires sandbox entitlements and App Store review)
- [ ] Android in-app purchase for Pro features (rich content transfer)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) for automated signing, notarization, and release
- [ ] Crash reporting / analytics (privacy-respecting, e.g., Sentry with minimal data)

---

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] Build a signed release APK/AAB and install on a real device — verify BLE pairing and clipboard sync work
- [ ] Build a signed + notarized macOS .app, put in a .dmg, download on a clean Mac — verify Gatekeeper passes and BLE works
- [ ] Test the full user journey: download from website/store → install → pair → sync clipboard both directions
